features in java 8
=====================================
1. interface enhancements
2. functional interface
3. lambda expression
4. stream api
5. date and time api
======================================
1. interface enhancements =
a. default methods = supports backward compatibility
       - there can be more than one default methods
       - it is available inside implementing class
       - default method helps in bringing backward compatibility
b. static methods =
       - there can be multiple static method in interface
       - not available in the implementing class
       - static method can be called by interface name
       - helps in achieving backward compatibility

c. functional interface
        -an interface having only one abstract method
        - any number of default and static method allowed
d. Lambda expression
        -OOP -> Programming should follow oop principle
        -functional programing - it should be in clear manner and lesser boilerPlate code
e. predicates
    - predefined functional interfaces that return boolean value
f. double colon operator
    - can be used as an alternative to lambda expressions
    - method reference -instance and static method
     -constructor reference
g. streams
    - helps to operate on collections
    - distinct function removes duplicates  and becomes unique
h. java8 date time api
    -In java7 date time api was not efficient
    -n java8 new date time api was introduced  which is also called joda date time api
